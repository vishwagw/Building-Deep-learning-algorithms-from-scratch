Neural networks are the fundamental strucutre of Deep learning. They are also a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. Just like the name, they are being created to simulate a human natural brain in a simplified way. 

With the rapid technoligal developments, we now can build deep neural networks with more advanced capabilites.

So in this project, we are going to create a neural network for recognizing handwritten digits with tensorflow. 

first we have to understand the prequisities.
to execute this program, we need :
python 3
tensorflow
numpy
image 


Step - 1
After importing the libraries, we need to import MNIST.
MNIST is a dataset. This dataset is made up of images of handwritten digits, 28x28 pixels in size.
